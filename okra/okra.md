	Oven fried okra: 
Heat over to 450.
Wash okra drain then slice . You don't want it real wet. Put about 1/4 cup Zartarans fish meal(gluten free) to about a pound of sliced okra. You don't want it heavily breaded.

	Shake in a covered bowl or bag. See, not much meal
	[03]
	Put just a little oil on your baking sheet
	[04
	Spread it around.

	Spread it around.

	Af the okra. Yout want it to breed no more than 1 layer weight plenty of room. This is about the most you want in the pan
	Spray well with cooking spray.  This step is VERY important.  I know you don't like Pam so use some oil in a spray bottle. If you don't do this,  it will not be nearly as good.  
	Bake for 20 to 30 minutes until golden brown.  I will send a pic when mine gets done. I'l never fry okra again. 
	Interpretation:多Af the okra. Yout want it to breed no more than 1 layer weight plenty of room. This is about the most you want in the pan.多Should read....多Add the okra. Yout want it to be no more than 1 layer with plenty of room. This is about the most you want in the pan多 
	Some recipes call for butter or Ice even seen olive oil.   Butter burns too easily in a  450 oven and I'm pretty sure I've read too never fry in Olive oil. The heat does something to it. Peanut oil is best.

	Tada!

	I did the same thing with pork chops. They took 40 minutes. I flipped one over halfway through cooking. Ican't tell the difference so next time no flipping
	Except the one I flipped lost some breading. Both cooked in the convection oven at the same time.

	I though it would be a major chore to clean the pan because of burned on oil, but not so with peanut oil because it had a high heat tolerance. 
	Except I didn't use Zartarans on thre pork chops. They turned out real tender.
	I think they would have been better with only 30 min.  I'l stop now.  Love you
